# Services-Architecture

I created new repository in .NET 8, C#

Repository contains two WEB API .NET Core Projects.

It uses EF Core to connect SQL Database and has simple functionality.

Please see the appsettings.json and lunchsettings.json for configurations.

From Design perspective db may not be perfect, and from clean code perspective code is not also perfect.

but since this assignment is not about that, I went with simple implementations.
